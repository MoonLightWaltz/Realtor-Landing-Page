<h3>Description</h3>
<br>
<p>This project incoprartes the use of SASS/SCSS CSS code for a more cleaner looking style. Used the BEM style of HTML class system for easy user readability. This project also includes seperation of code into parts and importing back to a main file called "main.scss" this was a small project I created over the course of the week, more so just a proof of concept. Trying to keep my front end skills sharp as I learn other aspects of code such as Java Script, data structures and Algorithm. </p>

<p>This project was made in conjecuntion to a course I am taking on Udemy. This course goes over moderen CSS design technicies to get myself used to more real world examples of sites that will need to be maintained. Project itself primerly focuses on CSS grid as I have used flex box for most of my other projects before this one. The course I am taken goes into depth about all the different implentations of CSS grid and its use cases. Its seems to streamline the process of moving things around while keeping it simple.
